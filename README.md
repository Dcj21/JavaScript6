### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. Rather than duplicate all the statements necessary to create and configure a new node, you can use the cloneNode()
method of the Documentobject to duplicate an existing node. 
2. A node you create with the createElement() method is not automatically attached to the DOM tree or to any other nodes. 
Instead, it exists independently of the DOM tree. 
3. The createElement() method is used to create a new element node.
